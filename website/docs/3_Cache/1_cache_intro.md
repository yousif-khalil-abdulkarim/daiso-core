# Cache intro

**What is a cache?**

A **cache** is like a coffee shop thats keeps extra milk in the fridge (cache) instead of running to the store (server) every time a customer orders a latte.

**Why use a cache?**

-   Retrieves data quicker than fetching from slow sources (like databases or the internet).

-   Minimizes delays for users, especially in high-traffic apps or websites.

-   Decreases the number of requests to databases or APIs, preventing overload.

-   Helps systems handle more users without slowing down.

-   Faster load times (e.g., cached images/videos on websites).
