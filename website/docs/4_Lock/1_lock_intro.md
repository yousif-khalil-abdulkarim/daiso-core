# Lock intro

**What is a Lock?**

A **lock** is like a public restroom (shared resource) with only one stall (critical section) and a key (lock) hanging at the front desk.

**Why use a lock?**

- Stops multiple servers or procceses or concurrent calls from corrupting shared data by allowing only one server or procces or concurrent call at a time.

- Guarantees operations complete fully before others see changes.
