# Event bus intro

**What is an event bus?**

A **event bus** is like a school announcement system: when the principal makes an announcement (event), every classroom (part of your app) that cares about it can hear and respond.

**Why use an event bus?**

-   Lets different parts of your app communicate without being tightly connected

-   Easy to add or change features later

-   Works great for big, complex apps
