**@daiso-tech/core** is a libary of backend server components designed for maximum flexibility. While each component is fully functional on its own, they are written to work seamlessly together to build robust server-side logic.

Key Features:
- **Framework Agnostic:** Built without a dependency injection (DI) container, the library integrates effortlessly into any framework / library. Whether you use Express.js, backend frameworks like AdonisJS or NestJS, or full-stack frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, or TanStack Start, these components "just work."

- **Runtime Portability:** By leveraging the Adapter Pattern, the library remains decoupled from specific runtimes. Easily implement custom adapters, such as Cloudflare Durable Objects or Amazon DynamoDB, for better serverless integration with cloudflare workers or aws lambda.

- **Test Friendly:** Testing is simple because every component comes with an "in-memory" adapter. This means you can run your tests instantly without needing to connect to a real database or server.

- **Developer Friendly:** Save time with high-quality documentation and a readable, well-documented codebase. Clear comments and a logical structure make it easy to understand and extend system functionality.
