## 0.61.0

### Minor Changes

- 83d134e: `ICacheAdapter.getOrAdd` now always takes a lazy function that produces the value to cache, instead of accepting either a plain value or a function. The value producer is invoked **only on a cache miss** (when the key is missing or expired), so the value is never computed when a cached entry already exists.

    This also makes adapters easier to implement: they no longer need to branch between plain values and functions and can rely on a single, uniform lazy invocation for the value to add.

- e77cc4f: Enhanced the event bus dispatch middlewares so you can return `null` from the `payload` invocable if you don't want to dispatch an event:

    - Return `null` from the `payload` of `withDispatchBefore` to skip dispatching and invoke the wrapped function directly.
    - Return `null` from the `payload` of `withDispatchAfter` to skip dispatching and return the wrapped function's result.
    - Return `null` from the `payload` of `withDispatchOnError` to skip dispatching and re-throw the original error.

    The `payload` type of the three middlewares is now `TEventMap[TEventName] | void`.

- 37a4973: Simplified the HttpRouter component with a unified schema-aware request API.

    ### Breaking changes
    - Replaced the `raw*` request accessors (`rawCookies`, `rawJson`, `rawFormData`, `rawParams`, `rawSearchParams`, `rawHeaders`) with `cookies()`, `json()`, `params()`, `searchParams()`, `headers()`, `fields()`, and `files()`.
    - Removed the `withSchema()` flow along with the `IValidatedHttpReq`, `IHttpReqBase`, `IHttpReqValidation`, `HttpReqSchemas`, and `ReqInputs` types. Each request accessor now accepts an optional Standard Schema directly and returns the validated result.
    - Removed the `ValidatedHttpReq` implementation.
    - `IHttpFileCollection.count` is now the `size()` method, and `IHttpFileCollection.isEmpty` is now the `isEmpty()` method.
    - `IHttpFileCollection.getOrFail()` and `firstOrFail()` now throw an `HttpError` with status `400` instead of the removed `FileIndexOutOfBoundsError` and `EmptyFileCollectionError`.
    - Removed the `FileIndexOutOfBoundsError` and `EmptyFileCollectionError` error classes.
    - `StaticFileDef.name` now accepts only a `RegExp` (previously `string | RegExp`).
    - `DynamicFileDef` now receives the uploaded `IHttpFileCollection` and returns an error message `string | null` (previously received an `IHttpFile` and returned a `StaticFileDef`).

    ### Additions
    - Added `CoercibleStringInputs` and `CoercibleMultiStringInputs` output types for schema-validated request data.
    - Added `payload` to `HttpError` (and `HttpErrorSettings.payload`), now used to carry validation issues.

    ### Validation behavior
    - Validation failures in `HttpReq` now throw an `HttpError` with status `400` and the validation issues attached as `payload`, instead of throwing `ValidationError`.

- 42f4765: Removed the unused force-release methods from the shared-lock component to simplify its API.

    ### Breaking changes
    - Removed `forceReleaseWriter` from `ISharedLockAdapter` and `IWriterLock`.
    - Removed `forceReleaseAllReaders` from `ISharedLockAdapter` and `IReaderSemaphore`.

    These methods allowed bypassing ownership checks to release locks for emergency or administrative cleanup, but they were redundant with the existing ownership-based release methods and have been removed along with their implementations in `KyselySharedLockAdapter`, `MemorySharedLockAdapter`, `MongodbSharedLockAdapter`, `NoOpSharedLockAdapter`, `RedisSharedLockAdapter`, the derived `SharedLock`, and the `withSharedLockPrefix` plugin.

    ### Migration

    Use the `forceRelease` method instead.

- 29a7a2d: - Reworked context tokens and unified them across modules. In the execution-context module, `ContextToken` is now a union of a new `ClassToken` (a class constructor used directly as the key) and `GenericToken`, whose identifier is a string `description` instead of a runtime-unique symbol. The DI `DiToken` is now a type alias of the execution-context `ContextToken`, so dependency injection and execution context now share a single token type.
    - Reworked `IDynamicServiceRegister`, used to set dynamic values inside `run()`:
        - `set` no longer accepts a `DynamicValueWrapper` callback as its value and is now synchronous. It writes the value directly to the execution context and implicitly overwrites an existing value for the token.
        - Added `get` and `getOrFail` to read a dynamic value, and `has` to check whether one is available. `getOrFail` throws `CanNotResolveServiceDiError` when the token is not registered as dynamic or has no value.
    - Dynamic values are now stored in and read from the execution context directly, instead of the container's isolated registry.
    - Renamed the `run()` setting `dynamicRegistration` to `registration`.
    - Added DI error flags thrown by the `IDynamicServiceRegister` methods:
        - `IDynamicServiceRegister.set` throws `CanNotRegisterServiceDiError.DYNAMIC_SERVICE_PROVIDER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN_IS_NOT_DYNAMIC` when the token is not registered as dynamic, and `CanNotRegisterServiceDiError.DYNAMIC_SERVICE_PROVIDER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN_DO_NOT_EXIST` when the token does not exist.
        - `IDynamicServiceRegister.getOrFail` throws `CanNotResolveServiceDiError.DYNAMIC_SERVICE_PROVIDER_NOT_DYNAMIC_TOKEN` when the token is not registered as dynamic.

### Patch Changes

- a9b309c: Fixed a bug in `MongodbLockAdapter.refresh` and `MongodbSharedLockAdapter.refreshWriter` where a caller that doesn't own the lock could still modify its expiration.

    Previously, both methods only filtered the MongoDB document by `key` and checked ownership _after_ the update was applied. As a result, calling `refresh` (or `refreshWriter`) with a stale or foreign `lockId`, or after the lock had already expired, would still mutate the stored expiration even though the method ultimately returned `false`.

    The owner and unexpired-expiration checks are now part of the MongoDB query filter itself, making the refresh conditional and atomic:

    - `MongodbLockAdapter.refresh` only updates documents matching `key`, `owner: lockId`, and an unexpired `expiration`.
    - `MongodbSharedLockAdapter.refreshWriter` only updates documents matching `key`, `writer.owner: lockId`, and an unexpired `writer.expiration`.

    A refresh by a non-owner (or of an expired lock) now leaves the document untouched and returns `false` as expected.

## 0.60.0

### Minor Changes

- 7be8c5e: Removed the usage of the `TimeSpan` class from the following adapter contracts, which now use `Date` for expiration/TTL values:

    - `ICacheAdapter`
    - `ISemaphoreAdapter`
    - `ILockAdapter`
    - `ISharedLockAdapter`
    - `IRateLimiterAdapter`

    This change decouples the contracts from other classes, making them easier to integrate with external libraries. Expiration values are now absolute, which also makes the tests less flaky.

- a6bae8f: # Re-add built-in schema validation for `Cache` and `EventBus`

    Re-added schema validation directly to the `Cache` and `EventBus` classes to improve the developer experience. Schemas are now inferred automatically from the corresponding settings, and the schema plugins are no longer part of the public API.

    ## Changes
    - `Cache` now accepts `schema` and `shouldValidateOutput` settings for validating cache values against a Standard-schema on write and, optionally, on read. `CacheSettingsBase` and `CacheSettings` are now generic over the cache value type.
    - `CacheResolver` now provides a `setSchema` method. `CacheAdapters` and `CacheResolverSettings` are now generic over the cache value type.
    - `EventBus` now accepts `eventMapSchema` and `shouldValidateListeners` settings for validating event data against a Standard-schema on dispatch and, optionally, when delivering events to listeners. `EventBusSettingsBase` and `EventBusSettings` are now generic over the event map.
    - `EventBusResolver` now provides a `setEventMapSchema` method, and its settings are now generic over the event map.
    - `withCacheSchema` and `withEventBusSchema` are no longer public plugins. They have been moved from `eridu-tech/cache/plugins` and `eridu-tech/event-bus/plugins` to internal derivables and are applied automatically by the `Cache` and `EventBus` constructors.
    - If you previously applied `withCacheSchema` or `withEventBusSchema` manually, remove the plugin and configure the corresponding schema settings on `Cache` or `EventBus` instead.

- 14cd6f3: Updated the `getOrAdd` method to support lazy value factories.

    `getOrAdd` now accepts either a concrete value or an invocable function that produces the value to store, instead of only a concrete value.

    - `ICacheAdapter.getOrAdd` now accepts `TType | InvocableFn<[], Promisable<TType>>` as `valueToAdd`.
    - `IWritableCache.getOrAdd` (and thus `ICache.getOrAdd`) accepts an `AsyncLazyable<TType>` as `valueToAdd`.
    - All built-in cache adapters (`KyselyCacheAdapter`, `MemoryCacheAdapter`, `MongodbCacheAdapter`, `NoOpCacheAdapter`, and `RedisCacheAdapter`) now resolve an invocable `valueToAdd` before storing it.
    - The `Cache` derivable now resolves the `AsyncLazyable` value before delegating to the underlying adapter.

- 454876e: Added the `withInvalidationFactory` middleware to `eridu-tech/cache/middlewares`.

    `withInvalidationFactory` creates a middleware that invalidates a cache entry after the wrapped function has been invoked. The cache key is derived from the wrapped function's arguments via the `key` setting. After the wrapped function runs, the `shouldInvalidate` setting decides whether to invalidate based on the function's arguments and return value; when it returns `true` (the default), the cache entry is removed from the provided `ICache`.

    This is useful for write-invalidation caching patterns, where stale cached data must be cleared after a mutation.

    ### Usage

    ```ts
    import { use } from "eridu-tech/middleware";
    import {
        withCacheFactory,
        withInvalidationFactory,
    } from "eridu-tech/cache/middlewares";
    import { MemoryCacheAdapter } from "eridu-tech/cache/memory-cache-adapter";
    import { Cache } from "eridu-tech/cache";

    const cache = new Cache({
        adapter: new MemoryCacheAdapter(),
    });
    const withCache = withCacheFactory(cache);
    const withInvalidation = withInvalidationFactory(cache);

    async function getUser(userId: string): Promise<User> {
        return fetchUser(userId);
    }

    // Cache the result of getUser keyed by the user id
    const getCachedUser = use(
        getUser,
        withCache({
            key: (userId: string) => `user:${userId}`,
        }),
    );

    async function updateUser(user: User): Promise<void> {
        await saveUser(user);
    }

    // Invalidate the cached user after saving the updated version
    const updateUserWithInvalidation = use(
        updateUser,
        withInvalidation({
            key: (user: User) => `user:${user.id}`,
        }),
    );
    ```

    ### Settings

    | Option             | Type                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                         |
    | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `key`              | `Invocable<TParameters, string>`                                | A function (or invocable object) that produces the cache key from the wrapped function's arguments                                                  |
    | `shouldInvalidate` | `Invocable<[args: TParameters, returnValue: TReturn], boolean>` | Determines whether to invalidate the cache entry after the wrapped function runs, based on its arguments and return value. Defaults to `() => true` |

- 0ac2312: Added three new dispatch middlewares to `eridu-tech/event-bus/middlewares`:

    - `withDispatchBeforeFactory` — dispatches an event **before** the wrapped function is invoked.
    - `withDispatchAfterFactory` — dispatches an event **after** the wrapped function resolves.
    - `withDispatchOnErrorFactory` — dispatches an event when the wrapped function **throws**, then re-throws the original error.

    Each factory takes an `IEventDispatcher` (such as an `EventBus`) and returns a middleware configured through a `settings` object containing the event `type` and a `payload`. The payload can be either a concrete value or an invocable that is resolved with a settings object before dispatching — `{ args }` for `withDispatchBeforeFactory`, `{ args, returnValue }` for `withDispatchAfterFactory`, and `{ args, error }` for `withDispatchOnErrorFactory`. This is useful for emitting lifecycle or failure events around a wrapped function.

    ### Usage

    ```ts
    import { use } from "eridu-tech/middleware";
    import {
        withDispatchBeforeFactory,
        withDispatchAfterFactory,
        withDispatchOnErrorFactory,
    } from "eridu-tech/event-bus/middlewares";
    import { MemoryEventBusAdapter } from "eridu-tech/event-bus/memory-event-bus";
    import { EventBus } from "eridu-tech/event-bus";

    type EventMap = {
        "user.before.create": { userId: string };
        "user.after.create": { userId: string; name: string };
        "user.error": { userId: string; error: unknown };
    };

    const eventBus = new EventBus<EventMap>({
        adapter: new MemoryEventBusAdapter(),
    });

    const withDispatchBefore = withDispatchBeforeFactory(eventBus);
    const withDispatchAfter = withDispatchAfterFactory(eventBus);
    const withDispatchOnError = withDispatchOnErrorFactory(eventBus);

    const createUser = use(
        (userId: string) => `user-${userId}`,
        withDispatchBefore({
            type: "user.before.create",
            payload: ({ args: [userId] }) => ({ userId }),
        }),
        withDispatchAfter({
            type: "user.after.create",
            payload: ({ args: [userId], returnValue }) => ({
                userId,
                name: returnValue,
            }),
        }),
        withDispatchOnError({
            type: "user.error",
            payload: ({ args: [userId], error }) => ({
                userId,
                error,
            }),
        }),
    );
    ```

- 9c61a49: Add `removeAllExpired` support to the in-memory adapters so expired data can be cleaned up.

    Previously, each in-memory adapter used a separate `setTimeout` per key to handle expiration. This approach is not performant because it requires more memory, and as more timers are scheduled, timing drift can occur. Expired data is now only removed when `removeAllExpired` is called (for example, on a regular interval or cron job).

    Affected adapters:

    - `MemoryCacheAdapter`
    - `MemoryLockAdapter`
    - `MemoryRateLimiterStorageAdapter`
    - `MemorySemaphoreAdapter`
    - `MemorySharedLockAdapter`

    Also includes internal refactors to the memory adapters (renaming underscore-prefixed internals) and documentation for the new `removeAllExpired` behavior.

- 10cd194: Updated the contract methods of the following adapters to remove the trailing `IReadableContext` argument:

    - `ICacheAdapter`
    - `ICircuitBreakerAdapter`
    - `ICircuitBreakerStorageAdapter`
    - `IEventBusAdapter`
    - `IFileUrlAdapter`
    - `IFileStorageAdapter`
    - `ISignedFileStorageAdapter`
    - `ILockAdapter`
    - `ISemaphoreAdapter`
    - `ISharedLockAdapter`
    - `IRateLimiterAdapter`
    - `IRateLimiterStorageAdapter`

    Before this update, the `IExecutionContext` was passed to classes such as `Cache` via the constructor. These classes never used the context themselves; they only forwarded it as `IReadableContext` to the underlying adapter. This was unnecessary indirection.

    After this update, an adapter that needs to be execution-context aware receives a shared `IExecutionContext` instance directly, avoiding the unnecessary indirection.

- 453b32a: Simplified `FileStorage` to require a signed file storage adapter.

    `FileStorage` and `FileStorageResolver` previously accepted any file storage adapter (signed or not) together with an optional partial `IFileUrlAdapter`, wrapping plain adapters internally in a `SignedFileStorageAdapter`. This wrapping is no longer done automatically.

    Changes:

    - `FileStorageSettings.adapter` now requires an `ISignedFileStorageAdapter` directly instead of `FileStorageAdapterVariants`.
    - Removed the `urlAdapter` setting from `FileStorage` and the `setUrlAdapter` method from `FileStorageResolver`.
    - Removed the `FileStorageAdapterVariants` contract type and the internal `isSignedFileStorageAdapter`.
    - Moved `SignedFileStorageAdapter` (with its `MergedFileUrlAdapter` and `NoOpFileUrlAdapter` helpers) from `implementations/derivables/file-storage/` to the new public `implementations/adapters/signed-file-storage-adapter/` location, importable from `"eridu-tech/file-storage/signed-file-storage-adapter"`. Its constructor now takes a `{ adapter, urlAdapter }` settings object.
    - `File` and `FileSerdeTransformer` no longer track a separate original adapter; serde transformer name resolution uses the adapter directly.

    To customize URL generation, wrap your storage adapter in a `SignedFileStorageAdapter` before passing it to `FileStorage` or `FileStorageResolver`.

- 482cbe1: Removed the `currentDate` option from `KyselySharedLockAdapterSettings`. It was an internal testing setting that is no longer used. The adapter now always uses the current time `Date.now()`.

### Patch Changes

- 11827f4: Fix a concurrency bug in `KyselySharedLockAdapter` where `getState` and `removeAllExpired` executed multiple database operations concurrently with `Promise.all`.

    Because `Promise.all` runs queries non-atomically, a partial failure or race condition could leave the shared-lock tables in an inconsistent state. These methods now run their internal operations sequentially inside a single database transaction, guaranteeing atomicity and data consistency.

- d7f809d: Fixed `RedisCacheAdapter` to use absolute expiration (`PXAT`) instead of relative TTL (`PX`) when setting key expirations.

    Previously, the adapter used Redis's relative expiration option (`PX`) and passed a duration in milliseconds (`ttl.toMilliseconds()`). With relative expiration, Redis only computes the expiry timestamp when the command is executed, so the effective lifetime of a key includes any network and command-processing latency. As a result, keys could outlive their requested `TimeSpan`, causing cache entries to drift from the intended expiration schedule.

    The adapter now converts the `TimeSpan` into an absolute expiration timestamp via `ttl.toEndDate().getTime()` and passes it to Redis using the `PXAT` option. This guarantees each key expires at exactly the intended moment, independent of when the command is actually processed by the server.

    Affected operations:

    - `getOrAdd` (the `eridu_cache_get_or_add` Lua script)
    - `add` (when a TTL is provided, using the `NX` guard)
    - `put` (when a TTL is provided, using the `GET` guard)

    The shared cache adapter test suite was also updated to use a larger delay buffer (`TTL / 2` instead of `TTL / 4`) so the assertions stay reliable under the higher timing precision of absolute expiration.

## 0.59.0

### Minor Changes

- dbcb9e3: # New DI Component: Eager Dependency-Injection Container

    A new dependency-injection (IoC) component is available at `eridu-tech/di`. The
    `./di` package export now resolves to the **eager** container implementation
    (`dist/di/implementations/eager`), and its public contract surface lives in
    `eridu-tech/di/contracts`.

    ## What's included
    - **Registrations** — `registerFactory`, `registerValue`, `registerDynamic`,
      plus `overrideFactory` / `overrideValue` for testing and `registerProvider`
      for grouped, provider-based registration.
    - **Lifetimes** — `singleton`, `transient`, and `scoped`.
    - **Object-literal dependencies** — factories declare dependencies as a record
      (`DepsTokens<TDeps>`) and receive a single `deps` object plus the current
      execution context: `ServiceFactory = Invocable<[deps, executionContext], ...>`.
    - **Scopes & forking** — `container.run()` executes a scope in which scoped
      services resolve once, and `container.fork()` creates child containers that
      inherit registrations and overrides.
    - **Graph validation** — on `init()`, the container validates the service graph
      and eagerly initializes singletons in dependency order, surfacing
      `InvalidGraphDiError` for cycles, invalid lifetime edges, and undeclared
      dependencies.

- dfa440e: # Architectural Shift: Composable FileStorage Plugins

    The file-storage module has undergone a significant architectural refactoring. Cross-cutting behaviours that were previously hard-coded into `FileStorage`, `FileStorageResolver`, and even `FsFileStorageAdapter` (key validation, lowercase normalisation, and content-type inference) have been extracted into standalone, composable plugins built on the middleware plugin system (`PluginFn`/`withPlugin`). The core `FileStorage` class is now a thin passthrough, while optional capabilities are layered on via plugins.

    ## Motivation

    The previous architecture baked key validation, lowercase normalisation, and content-type inference directly into the core classes and the filesystem adapter. This made these behaviours difficult to opt out of, mix, reorder, or reuse across different adapters, and forced every consumer to pay the cost of behaviour they might not need.

    The new plugin-based architecture keeps the core classes focused on a single responsibility — delegating to an `IFileStorageAdapter` — and provides each cross-cutting behaviour as an independent `PluginFn<IFileStorageAdapter>` that can be composed via `withPlugin(adapter, ...plugins)`.

    ### Breaking Changes

    **Removed from `FileStorage` / `FileStorageSettingsBase`:**

    - The `defaultContentType` setting — content-type inference is now handled by the `withFileStorageInferContentTypeOnWrite` / `withFileStorageInferContentTypeOnRead` plugins. `application/octet-stream` is used as the default content type on write and read unless you use a plugin that can infer the content type.
    - The `onlyLowercase` setting — key lowercasing is now handled by the `withFileStorageLowerCase` plugin.
    - The `keyValidator` setting — key validation is now handled by the `withFileStorageKeyValidator` plugin.

    **Removed from `FileStorageResolver`:**

    - `setDefaultContentType(contentType)` — use the content-type inference plugins instead.
    - `setOnlyLowercase(onlyLowercase)` — use the `withFileStorageLowerCase` plugin instead.
    - `setKeyValidator(keyValidator)` — use the `withFileStorageKeyValidator` plugin instead.

    **Moved exports:**

    - `defaultKeyValidator` and `FileKeyValidator` are no longer exported from `eridu-tech/file-storage`. They now live in the plugins module alongside `withFileStorageKeyValidator`.

    **Changed contracts:**

    - `FileAdapterMetadata.contentType` is now `string | null`. A `null` value indicates the storage backend does not store or expose a content type for the file; reading such metadata through `FileStorage` falls back to `application/octet-stream` unless a content-type inference plugin is applied.

    **Changed adapter behaviour:**

    - `FsFileStorageAdapter.getMetaData` no longer infers the content type from the file key extension and now reports `null` for the content type. Apply the `withFileStorageInferContentTypeOnRead` or `withFileStorageInferFileTypeOnRead` plugins to restore content-type inference.

    ### New Plugins

    The plugins below are applied to a file-storage adapter with `withPlugin(adapter, ...plugins)`.

    **`withFileStorageKeyValidator`** — Validates every file key before it reaches a file-storage adapter. When a key fails validation, an `InvalidKeyFileError` is thrown and the underlying adapter method is never invoked.

    - Uses the built-in `defaultKeyValidator` by default, which rejects keys containing `../`, newlines (`\n`), tabs (`\t`), and keys that are empty or whitespace-only.
    - A custom validator can be supplied as the first argument.

    ```ts
    import { withPlugin } from "eridu-tech/middleware";
    import { MemoryFileStorageAdapter } from "eridu-tech/file-storage/memory-file-storage-adapter";
    import { withFileStorageKeyValidator } from "eridu-tech/file-storage/plugins";

    const adapter = withPlugin(
        new MemoryFileStorageAdapter(),
        withFileStorageKeyValidator(),
    );
    ```

    **`withFileStorageLowerCase`** — Lowercases every file key before it reaches the underlying adapter, enforcing a consistent, case-insensitive key format.

    ```ts
    import { withPlugin } from "eridu-tech/middleware";
    import { MemoryFileStorageAdapter } from "eridu-tech/file-storage/memory-file-storage-adapter";
    import { withFileStorageLowerCase } from "eridu-tech/file-storage/plugins";

    const adapter = withPlugin(
        new MemoryFileStorageAdapter(),
        withFileStorageLowerCase(),
    );
    ```

    **`withFileStorageInferContentTypeOnRead`** — Infers the content type from the file key extension when reading file metadata (`getMetaData`). Meant for adapters that cannot save the content type of a file and instead need it inferred, such as `FsFileStorageAdapter`.

    **`withFileStorageInferContentTypeOnWrite`** — Infers the content type from the file key extension when writing files or generating signed URLs. Inference for signed URLs can be toggled via the `inferSignedDownloadUrl` and `inferSignedUploadUrl` settings (both default to `true`).

    **`withFileStorageInferFileTypeOnRead`** — Infers the content type from the actual file bytes (via the `file-type` library) when reading file metadata.

    **`withFileStorageInferFileTypeOnWrite`** — Infers the content type from the actual file bytes (via the `file-type` library) when writing files, so files with misleading or missing extensions still get an accurate content type.

    ### Migration

    **Before (built-in behaviour):**

    ```ts
    const fileStorage = new FileStorage({
        adapter: new MemoryFileStorageAdapter(),
        defaultContentType: "application/octet-stream",
        onlyLowercase: true,
        keyValidator: myValidator,
    });
    ```

    **After (explicit plugin composition):**

    ```ts
    import { withPlugin } from "eridu-tech/middleware";
    import { MemoryFileStorageAdapter } from "eridu-tech/file-storage/memory-file-storage-adapter";
    import {
        withFileStorageKeyValidator,
        withFileStorageLowerCase,
    } from "eridu-tech/file-storage/plugins";

    const adapter = withPlugin(
        new MemoryFileStorageAdapter(),
        withFileStorageKeyValidator(myValidator),
        withFileStorageLowerCase(),
    );
    const fileStorage = new FileStorage({ adapter });
    ```

    ### New Dependency
    - Added `file-type` for content-based file type detection, used by the file-type inference plugins.

## 0.58.0

### Minor Changes

- bbfafec: ## Cache adapter API simplification

    Simplified the `ICacheAdapter` contract by removing the `removeAll` method and renaming `removeByKeyPrefix` to `removeByPrefix`.

    ### What changed
    - **Removed** `ICacheAdapter.removeAll(context)`.
    - **Renamed** `ICacheAdapter.removeByKeyPrefix(prefix, context)` to `ICacheAdapter.removeByPrefix(prefix, context)`.
    - Calling `removeByPrefix` with an empty string prefix (`""`) now clears the entire cache, which replaces the removed `removeAll` method.

    ### Migration
    - Replace calls to `removeAll(context)` with `removeByPrefix("", context)`.
    - Rename any calls to `removeByKeyPrefix(prefix, context)` to `removeByPrefix(prefix, context)`.
    - If you maintain a custom implementation of `ICacheAdapter`, update it to the new contract and remove the `removeAll` method.

## 0.57.4

### Patch Changes

- 95bc7f2: Changed all type-only imports to the top-level `import type` form and adjusted the ESLint config accordingly, so the compiled output no longer emits runtime side-effect imports for type-only packages like `@standard-schema/spec` (fixes `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for consumers).

## 0.57.3

### Patch Changes

- e513526: Updated dependency versions.

    > **Minimum Node.js version is now `>=24`** — added via the `engines` field in `package.json`. Ensure your runtime uses Node.js 24 or newer.

## 0.57.2

### Patch Changes

- 50d8345: First release under the new package name

## 0.57.1

### Patch Changes

- 121c86c: Updated readme

## 0.57.0

### Minor Changes

- f04a94b: Renamed `IInvokableObject` to `IInvocableObject` type
  Renamed `InvokableFn` to `InvocableFn` type
  Renamed `Invokable` to `Invocable` type
- dc2a537: ## Simplified Database Adapter Settings

    Removed the `enableTransactions`, `shouldRemoveExpiredKeys`, and `expiredKeysRemovalInterval` settings from all database-backed adapters. Database operations are now always wrapped in a transaction, and the built-in background cleanup of expired records has been removed.

    ### What changed

    **Removed `enableTransactions` from:**

    - `KyselyCacheAdapter`
    - `KyselyCircuitBreakerStorageAdapter`
    - `KyselyLockAdapter`
    - `KyselyRateLimiterStorageAdapter`
    - `KyselySemaphoreAdapter`
    - `KyselySharedLockAdapter`
    - `MongodbCircuitBreakerStorageAdapter`
    - `MongodbRateLimiterStorageAdapter`

    Every operation is now always executed inside a database transaction (with `serializable` isolation for the Kysely lock, semaphore, and shared-lock adapters), which matches the previous default behavior.

    **Removed `shouldRemoveExpiredKeys` and `expiredKeysRemovalInterval` from:**

    - `KyselyCacheAdapter`
    - `KyselyLockAdapter`
    - `KyselyRateLimiterStorageAdapter`
    - `KyselySemaphoreAdapter`
    - `KyselySharedLockAdapter`

    The background task that periodically removed expired records is no longer started automatically.

    ### Migration
    - Remove any `enableTransactions`, `shouldRemoveExpiredKeys`, or `expiredKeysRemovalInterval` options from adapter settings — they are no longer accepted.
    - If you relied on automatic expired-key cleanup, schedule `removeAllExpired()` yourself (e.g. with a cron job or `setInterval`), as the adapters no longer run it in the background.

## 0.56.0

### Minor Changes

- 12a2908: ## Execution Context Integration for All Adapters

    All adapter contracts across `Cache`, `CircuitBreaker`, `EventBus`, `FileStorage`, `Lock`, `RateLimiter`, `Semaphore`, and `SharedLock` now accept an `IReadableContext` parameter as the last argument on every method. This enables passing execution-scoped metadata — such as request IDs, tenant IDs, correlation tokens, or authentication context — through the adapter layer without adding framework-specific coupling.

    ### Motivation

    Previously, adapter methods had no standard mechanism to receive execution-scoped metadata. Users who needed to propagate context (e.g., for logging, tracing, or tenant isolation) had to implement workarounds such as storing context in closures, using global state, or threading custom parameters through non-standard extensions.

    By adding `context: IReadableContext` as the final parameter on all adapter methods, the execution context becomes a first-class citizen of the adapter contract. This follows the dependency inversion principle — adapters depend on the abstract `IReadableContext` interface rather than any concrete context implementation, keeping them portable across environments.

    ### Breaking Changes

    **All adapter methods** across the following contracts now require `context: IReadableContext` as the last positional argument:

    | Contract                 | Affected Methods                                                                                                                                                                                       |
    | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | `ICacheAdapter`          | `get`, `getAndRemove`, `add`, `getOrAdd`, `put`, `update`, `increment`, `removeMany`, `removeAll`, `removeByKeyPrefix`                                                                                 |
    | `ILockAdapter`           | `acquire`, `release`, `forceRelease`, `refresh`, `getState`                                                                                                                                            |
    | `ICircuitBreakerAdapter` | `getState`, `trackFailure`, `trackSuccess`, `updateState`, `reset`, `isolate`                                                                                                                          |
    | `IEventBusAdapter`       | `dispatch`, `addListener`, `removeListener`                                                                                                                                                            |
    | `IFileStorageAdapter`    | `exists`, `getStream`, `getBytes`, `getMetaData`, `add`, `addStream`, `update`, `updateStream`, `put`, `putStream`, `copy`, `copyAndReplace`, `move`, `moveAndReplace`, `removeMany`, `removeByPrefix` |
    | `IFileUrlAdapter`        | `getPublicUrl`, `getSignedDownloadUrl`, `getSignedUploadUrl`                                                                                                                                           |
    | `IRateLimiterAdapter`    | `getState`, `reset`, `updateState`                                                                                                                                                                     |
    | `ISemaphoreAdapter`      | `release`, `forceReleaseAll`, `refresh`, `getState`                                                                                                                                                    |
    | `ISharedLockAdapter`     | `acquireWriter`, `releaseWriter`, `forceReleaseWriter`, `refreshWriter`, `releaseReader`, `forceReleaseAllReaders`, `refreshReader`, `forceRelease`, `getState`                                        |

    **Note:** `ISemaphoreAdapter.acquire` and `ISharedLockAdapter.acquireReader` accept `context` via a settings object (`SemaphoreAcquireSettings` / `SharedLockAcquireSettings`) rather than as a positional argument, due to the number of parameters involved.

    ### Migration

    All call sites that invoke adapter methods directly must now pass a `context: IReadableContext` value as the last argument. In test environments, use `NoOpContext`:

    ```diff
    -import { NoOpContext } from "@daiso-tech/core/execution-context";
    -
    -const context = new NoOpContext();
    -await adapter.get(context, "myKey");
    +import { NoOpContext } from "@daiso-tech/core/execution-context";
    +
    +const context = new NoOpContext();
    +await adapter.get("myKey", context);
    ```

    All built-in adapter implementations (`Redis*Adapter`, `Kysely*Adapter`, `Memory*Adapter`, `MongoDB*Adapter`, `NoOp*Adapter`) have already been updated to accept and propagate the context parameter.

- 5c28ea2: ## Architectural Shift: Composable Cache Plugins

    The cache module has undergone a significant architectural refactoring. Behaviours that were previously hard-coded into the `Cache` and `CacheResolver` implementations — schema validation, TTL jitter, and write-lock serialisation — have been extracted into standalone, composable plugins. The core `Cache` class is now a thin passthrough that delegates operations directly to the underlying `ICacheAdapter`, while optional capabilities are layered on via the middleware plugin system (`PluginFn`/`withPlugin`).

    ### Motivation

    The previous architecture baked cross-cutting concerns like schema validation, TTL jittering, and distributed write locking directly into the `Cache` and `CacheResolver` classes. This had several drawbacks:

    - **Tight coupling**: Users who wanted only one feature (e.g., schema validation) still paid the overhead of the other features.
    - **Difficult to extend**: Adding new cross-cutting behaviours required modifying the core `Cache` class, increasing complexity and risk.
    - **No composability**: Behaviours could not be mixed, matched, or reordered independently.
    - **Testing complexity**: Core cache tests had to account for all combined behaviours.

    The new plugin-based architecture solves these problems by keeping the `Cache` class focused on a single responsibility — delegating to an `ICacheAdapter` — and providing each cross-cutting behaviour as an independent `PluginFn<ICacheAdapter>` that can be composed via `withPlugin(adapter, ...plugins)`.

    ### Breaking Changes

    **Removed from `CacheSettingsBase`:**

    - `schema` — use the `withCacheSchema` plugin instead.
    - `lockFactory` — use the `withCacheWriteLock` plugin instead.

    **Removed types:**

    - `CacheWriteSettings` — TTL is now passed as an inline `ITimeSpan | null` parameter on `add`, `put`, `getOrAdd`, and related methods.

    **Changed API signatures:**

    - `Cache` constructor no longer accepts `schema` or `lockFactory` settings.
    - `CacheResolver` no longer carries schema or write-lock configuration.
    - `ICache.getOrAdd` now accepts `ttl?: ITimeSpan | null` as its third parameter instead of a `CacheWriteSettings` object.

    ### New Plugin-Based Capabilities

    The following behaviours are no longer built into `Cache` or `CacheResolver`. They are available as opt-in plugins:

    **`withCacheJitter`** — Adds random jitter to TTL values on `add` and `put` operations to help prevent cache stampedes (thundering-herd problems).

    - Configurable via `defaultJitter` (default ±20 %).
    - `WITHOUT` this plugin, TTLs are stored as-is — no jitter is applied.
    - Import path: `@daiso-tech/core/cache/plugins`

    **`withCacheSchema`** — Validates cache values against a `StandardSchemaV1`-compliant schema before storing (`add`, `put`, `update`) and optionally on retrieval (`get`, `getAndRemove`).

    - Controlled via `shouldValidateOutput` (default `true`).
    - `WITHOUT` this plugin, no schema validation occurs — any value type is accepted.
    - Import path: `@daiso-tech/core/cache/plugins`

    **`withCacheWriteLock`** — Acquires a distributed lock via `ILockFactory` before executing mutating cache operations (`add`, `put`, `update`, `increment`, `getAndRemove`, `removeMany`), ensuring concurrent writes to the same cache entry are serialised.

    - The set of protected methods is configurable via `onlyMethods`.
    - `WITHOUT` this plugin, concurrent writes proceed without locking — the adapter's own concurrency guarantees apply.
    - Import path: `@daiso-tech/core/cache/plugins`

    ### How the New Architecture Works

    The `Cache` class has been simplified to a thin wrapper that:

    1. Accepts an `ICacheAdapter` (optionally enhanced by plugins) via `CacheSettings.adapter`.
    2. Delegates every operation (`get`, `add`, `put`, `update`, `increment`, `remove`, `clear`, etc.) directly to the adapter.
    3. No longer performs schema validation, TTL jittering, or write-lock acquisition internally.

    ### Migration

    Users who relied on the previous built-in schema validation, TTL jitter, or write-lock behaviour must now explicitly compose the corresponding plugins.

    | Previous behaviour                      | New requirement                                               |
    | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Schema validation on cache reads/writes | Apply `withCacheSchema({ schema })` to the adapter            |
    | TTL jitter to prevent stampedes         | Apply `withCacheJitter({ defaultJitter })` to the adapter     |
    | Distributed write locking               | Apply `withCacheWriteLock({ lockFactory })` to the adapter    |
    | All three behaviours combined           | Apply all three plugins via `withPlugin(adapter, p1, p2, p3)` |

    **Before (built-in behaviour):**

    ```ts
    const cache = new Cache({ adapter, schema: mySchema });
    ```

    **After (explicit plugin composition):**

    ```ts
    import { withPlugin } from "@daiso-tech/core/middleware";
    import { withCacheSchema } from "@daiso-tech/core/cache/plugins";

    const adapter = withPlugin(
        new MemoryCacheAdapter(),
        withCacheSchema({ schema: mySchema }),
    );
    const cache = new Cache({ adapter });
    ```

    If you do not apply any plugins, the cache behaves as a pure passthrough — no validation, no jitter, no locking. This reduces overhead when these features are not needed.

- 2467757: ## Architectural Shift: Composable EventBus Plugins

    The event-bus module has undergone a significant architectural refactoring. Schema validation that was previously hard-coded into the `EventBus` class has been extracted into a standalone, composable plugin. The core `EventBus` class is now a thin passthrough that delegates operations directly to the underlying `IEventBusAdapter`, while optional capabilities are layered on via the middleware plugin system (`PluginFn`/`withPlugin`).

    ### Motivation

    The previous architecture baked schema validation directly into the `EventBus` and `EventBusResolver` classes. This had several drawbacks:

    - **Tight coupling**: Users who didn't need schema validation still paid the overhead of importing the validation infrastructure.
    - **Difficult to extend**: Adding new cross-cutting behaviours (such as event name prefixing) required modifying the core `EventBus` class.
    - **No composability**: Behaviours could not be mixed, matched, or reordered independently.
    - **Testing complexity**: Core EventBus tests had to account for all combined validation scenarios.

    The new plugin-based architecture solves these problems by keeping the `EventBus` class focused on a single responsibility — delegating to an `IEventBusAdapter` — and providing each cross-cutting behaviour as an independent `PluginFn<IEventBusAdapter>` that can be composed via `withPlugin(adapter, ...plugins)`.

    ### Breaking Changes

    **Removed from `EventBus` class:**

    - `EventBusSettings` and `EventBusSettingsBase` no longer accept `eventMapSchema` or `shouldValidateOutput`. These are now configured via the `withEventBusSchema` plugin.
    - `EventBusSettings` is no longer generic over `TEventMap` — the constructor signature is now `constructor(settings: EventBusSettings)` instead of `constructor(settings: EventBusSettings<TEventMap>)`.

    **Removed from `EventBusResolver` class:**

    - `EventBusResolverSettings` no longer accepts the `TEventMap` generic parameter — simplified to `EventBusResolverSettings<TAdapters>`.
    - The `setEventMapSchema()` method has been removed. Use the `withEventBusSchema` plugin instead.

    **Removed types:**

    - `EventMapSchema` (previously exported from `@daiso-tech/core/event-bus`) — now exported from `@daiso-tech/core/event-bus/plugins` with an updated API.

    **Removed behaviour:**

    - The `EventBus` class no longer validates event data on `dispatch`, nor validates listener output on `addListener`, `listenOnce`, `asPromise`, `subscribeOnce`, or `subscribe`. Schema validation is now opt-in via the `withEventBusSchema` plugin.

    ### New Plugin-Based Capabilities

    The following behaviours are no longer built into `EventBus`. They are available as opt-in plugins:

    **`withEventBusSchema`** — Validates event data against a `StandardSchemaV1`-compliant schema map. On `dispatch`, the event data is validated before being forwarded to the adapter. When `shouldValidateListeners` is `true` (default), listener functions are also wrapped to validate event data before it reaches the listener.

    - The `defineEventMapSchema` helper provides type-safety when defining the schema map.
    - `WITHOUT` this plugin, no schema validation occurs — any event data is accepted.
    - Import path: `@daiso-tech/core/event-bus/plugins`

    ```ts
    import { withPlugin } from "@daiso-tech/core/middleware";
    import { MemoryEventBusAdapter } from "@daiso-tech/core/event-bus/memory-event-bus-adapter";
    import { withEventBusSchema } from "@daiso-tech/core/event-bus/plugins";
    import { z } from "zod";

    const adapter = withPlugin(
        new MemoryEventBusAdapter(),
        withEventBusSchema({
            eventMapSchema: {
                add: z.object({ a: z.number(), b: z.number() }),
            },
        }),
    );
    ```

    **`withEventBusPrefix`** — Prefixes all event names passed to an event bus adapter. Every method that accepts an event name (`dispatch`, `addListener`, `removeListener`) will have the given prefix prepended before the call is forwarded to the underlying adapter.

    - Useful for multi-tenant systems, environment isolation, and module scoping.
    - Import path: `@daiso-tech/core/event-bus/plugins`

    ```ts
    import { withPlugin } from "@daiso-tech/core/middleware";
    import { MemoryEventBusAdapter } from "@daiso-tech/core/event-bus/memory-event-bus-adapter";
    import { withEventBusPrefix } from "@daiso-tech/core/event-bus/plugins";

    const adapter = withPlugin(
        new MemoryEventBusAdapter(),
        withEventBusPrefix("app:"),
    );
    ```

    **`withListenerTracking`** — Solves the listener reference tracking problem that arises when middleware plugins wrap listener functions in `addListener`. It maintains an internal `original → wrapper` mapping so that `removeListener` correctly resolves the original listener to its wrapped counterpart before forwarding.

    - Use this when composing plugins that wrap listeners (like `withEventBusSchema` with `shouldValidateListeners` enabled).
    - Import path: `@daiso-tech/core/event-bus/plugins`

    ```ts
    import { withPlugin } from "@daiso-tech/core/middleware";
    import { MemoryEventBusAdapter } from "@daiso-tech/core/event-bus/memory-event-bus-adapter";
    import {
        withEventBusSchema,
        withListenerTracking,
        defineEventMapSchema,
    } from "@daiso-tech/core/event-bus/plugins";
    import { z } from "zod";

    const eventMapSchema = defineEventMapSchema({
        add: z.object({ a: z.number(), b: z.number() }),
    });
    const adapter = withPlugin(
        new MemoryEventBusAdapter(),
        withListenerTracking(withEventBusSchema({ eventMapSchema })),
    );
    ```

    ### How the New Architecture Works

    The `EventBus` class has been simplified to a thin wrapper that:

    1. Accepts an `IEventBusAdapter` (optionally enhanced by plugins) via `EventBusSettings.adapter`.
    2. Delegates every operation (`dispatch`, `addListener`, `removeListener`, `listenOnce`, `asPromise`, `subscribeOnce`, `subscribe`) directly to the adapter.
    3. No longer performs schema validation internally.

    Plugins receive the adapter and an `enhance` function, allowing them to intercept and modify specific methods using the same middleware pattern used by all other daiso-core components.

    ### Migration

    **Before (built-in validation):**

    ```ts
    const eventBus = new EventBus({
        adapter: new MemoryEventBusAdapter(),
        eventMapSchema,
    });
    ```

    **After (explicit plugin composition):**

    ```ts
    import { withPlugin } from "@daiso-tech/core/middleware";
    import { withEventBusSchema } from "@daiso-tech/core/event-bus/plugins";

    const adapter = withPlugin(
        new MemoryEventBusAdapter(),
        withEventBusSchema({ eventMapSchema }),
    );
    const eventBus = new EventBus({ adapter });
    ```

    ### New Export Path

    A new export path has been added to `package.json`:

    ```
    @daiso-tech/core/event-bus/plugins
    ```

    This exports `withEventBusSchema`, `withEventBusPrefix`, `withListenerTracking`, `EventMapSchema`, `WithEventBusSchemaSettings`, and `defineEventMapSchema`.

- 6594c43: ## Simplified Cache Adapter Contract

    The `IDatabaseCacheAdapter`, `IDatabaseCacheTransaction`, and `ICacheData` contracts have been removed in favor of the simpler `ICacheAdapter` contract. This eliminates the transaction-based database abstraction layer, making the cache adapter interface more straightforward.

    ### Motivation

    The `IDatabaseCacheAdapter` contract introduced unnecessary complexity by wrapping all results in `ICacheData` / `ICacheDataExpiration` objects and requiring transaction support. The simpler `ICacheAdapter` contract returns primitive values directly, reducing boilerplate for adapter implementors and improving runtime performance.

    ### Breaking Changes

    **Removed types:**

    - `IDatabaseCacheAdapter`
    - `IDatabaseCacheTransaction`
    - `ICacheData`
    - `ICacheDataExpiration`

    **Removed test utility:**

    - `databaseCacheAdapterTestSuite` — use `cacheAdapterTestSuite` instead.

    **Refactored adapters:**

    - `KyselyCacheAdapter` now implements `ICacheAdapter` directly instead of `IDatabaseCacheAdapter`.

    ### Migration

    Custom `IDatabaseCacheAdapter` implementations should migrate to `ICacheAdapter`. The new contract expects methods to return primitive values (`TType | null`, `boolean`, `void`) directly instead of wrapping results in `ICacheData` / `ICacheDataExpiration` objects. Use `cacheAdapterTestSuite` instead of `databaseCacheAdapterTestSuite` for testing.

- 1f6cbd6: ## Simplified Lock Adapter Contract

    The `IDatabaseLockAdapter`, `IDatabaseLockTransaction`, and `ILockData` contracts have been removed in favor of the simpler `ILockAdapter` contract. This eliminates the transaction-based database abstraction layer, making the lock adapter interface more straightforward.

    ### Motivation

    The `IDatabaseLockAdapter` contract introduced unnecessary complexity by wrapping results in `ILockData` / `ILockExpirationData` objects and requiring transaction support. The simpler `ILockAdapter` contract returns primitive values directly, reducing boilerplate for adapter implementors and improving runtime performance.

    ### Breaking Changes

    **Removed types:**

    - `IDatabaseLockAdapter`
    - `IDatabaseLockTransaction`
    - `ILockData`
    - `ILockExpirationData`

    **Removed test utility:**

    - `databaseLockAdapterTestSuite` — use `lockAdapterTestSuite` instead.

    **Removed classes:**

    - `DatabaseLockAdapter` derivable class

    **Refactored adapters:**

    - `KyselyLockAdapter` now implements `ILockAdapter` directly with `acquire`, `release`, `forceRelease`, `refresh`, and `getState` methods.

    ### Migration

    Custom `IDatabaseLockAdapter` implementations should migrate to `ILockAdapter`. The new contract expects methods with the following signatures:

    - `acquire(context, key, lockId, ttl): Promise<boolean>`
    - `release(context, key, lockId): Promise<boolean>`
    - `forceRelease(context, key): Promise<boolean>`
    - `refresh(context, key, lockId, ttl): Promise<boolean>`
    - `getState(context, key): Promise<ILockAdapterState | null>`

    Use `lockAdapterTestSuite` instead of `databaseLockAdapterTestSuite` for testing. Replace custom `DatabaseLockAdapter` subclasses with direct `ILockAdapter` implementations.

- 69c0ddf: ## Simplified Semaphore Adapter Contract

    The `IDatabaseSemaphoreAdapter`, `IDatabaseSemaphoreTransaction`, and related data contracts have been removed in favor of the simpler `ISemaphoreAdapter` contract. This eliminates the transaction-based database abstraction layer, making the semaphore adapter interface more straightforward.

    ### Motivation

    The `IDatabaseSemaphoreAdapter` contract introduced unnecessary complexity by wrapping results in `ISemaphoreData`, `ISemaphoreSlotData`, and `ISemaphoreSlotExpirationData` objects and requiring transaction support. The simpler `ISemaphoreAdapter` contract returns primitive values directly, reducing boilerplate for adapter implementors and improving runtime performance.

    ### Breaking Changes

    **Removed types:**

    - `IDatabaseSemaphoreAdapter`
    - `IDatabaseSemaphoreTransaction`
    - `ISemaphoreData`
    - `ISemaphoreSlotData`
    - `ISemaphoreSlotExpirationData`

    **Removed test utility:**

    - `databaseSemaphoreAdapterTestSuite` — use `semaphoreAdapterTestSuite` instead.

    **Refactored adapters:**

    - `KyselySemaphoreAdapter` now implements `ISemaphoreAdapter` directly with `acquire`, `release`, `forceReleaseAll`, `refresh`, and `getState` methods.

    ### Migration

    Custom `IDatabaseSemaphoreAdapter` implementations should migrate to `ISemaphoreAdapter`. The new contract expects methods with the following signatures:

    - `acquire(settings: SemaphoreAcquireSettings): Promise<boolean>`
    - `release(context, key, slotId): Promise<boolean>`
    - `forceReleaseAll(context, key): Promise<boolean>`
    - `refresh(context, key, slotId, ttl): Promise<boolean>`
    - `getState(context, key): Promise<ISemaphoreAdapterState | null>`

    Use `semaphoreAdapterTestSuite` instead of `databaseSemaphoreAdapterTestSuite` for testing. Replace custom `IDatabaseSemaphoreAdapter` subclasses with direct `ISemaphoreAdapter` implementations.

- 69c0ddf: ## Simplified Shared Lock Adapter Contract

    The `IDatabaseSharedLockAdapter`, `IDatabaseSharedLockTransaction`, and related data contracts have been removed in favor of the simpler `ISharedLockAdapter` contract. This eliminates the transaction-based database abstraction layer, making the shared-lock adapter interface more straightforward.

    ### Motivation

    The `IDatabaseSharedLockAdapter` contract introduced unnecessary complexity by wrapping results in `IWriterLockData`, `IReaderSemaphoreData`, and related objects, while requiring transaction support. The simpler `ISharedLockAdapter` contract returns primitive values directly, reducing boilerplate for adapter implementors and improving runtime performance.

    ### Breaking Changes

    **Removed types:**

    - `IDatabaseSharedLockAdapter`
    - `IDatabaseSharedLockTransaction`
    - `IWriterLockData`
    - `IWriterLockExpirationData`
    - `IReaderSemaphoreSlotExpirationData`
    - `IReaderSemaphoreSlotData`
    - `IReaderSemaphoreData`

    **Removed test utility:**

    - `databaseSharedLockAdapterTestSuite` — use `sharedLockAdapterTestSuite` instead.

    **Removed classes:**

    - `DatabaseSharedLockAdapter` derivable class

    **Refactored adapters:**

    - `KyselySharedLockAdapter` now implements `ISharedLockAdapter` directly with `acquireWriter`, `releaseWriter`, `forceReleaseWriter`, `refreshWriter`, `acquireReader`, `releaseReader`, `forceReleaseAllReaders`, `refreshReader`, `forceRelease`, and `getState` methods.

    ### Migration

    Custom `IDatabaseSharedLockAdapter` implementations should migrate to `ISharedLockAdapter`. The new contract expects methods with the following signatures:

    - `acquireWriter(context, key, lockId, ttl): Promise<boolean>`
    - `releaseWriter(context, key, lockId): Promise<boolean>`
    - `forceReleaseWriter(context, key): Promise<boolean>`
    - `refreshWriter(context, key, lockId, ttl): Promise<boolean>`
    - `acquireReader(settings: SharedLockAcquireSettings): Promise<boolean>`
    - `releaseReader(context, key, slotId): Promise<boolean>`
    - `forceReleaseAllReaders(context, key): Promise<boolean>`
    - `refreshReader(context, key, slotId, ttl): Promise<boolean>`
    - `forceRelease(context, key): Promise<boolean>`
    - `getState(context, key): Promise<ISharedLockAdapterState | null>`

    Use `sharedLockAdapterTestSuite` instead of `databaseSharedLockAdapterTestSuite` for testing. Replace custom `DatabaseSharedLockAdapter` subclasses with direct `ISharedLockAdapter` implementations.

- 2e8ee5d: ## Cross-Platform File Storage and Extracted Locking

    The `IFileStorage` contract has been updated to remove Node.js-specific read methods and extract built-in locking into a standalone plugin. The `FileStorage` class now works in non-Node.js environments such as Cloudflare Workers without requiring Node.js compatibility.

    ### Motivation

    The previous `IFileStorage` contract included Node.js-specific methods (`getBuffer`, `getReadable`) that prevented the component from working in edge-runtime environments. Additionally, built-in locking coupled the `FileStorage` class to the lock infrastructure even for users who didn't need it. By extracting locking into a plugin and replacing Node-specific APIs with runtime-agnostic alternatives, the file-storage module is now portable across environments.

    ### Breaking Changes

    **Removed methods from `IFile`:**

    - `IFile.getBuffer` — use `IFile.getBytes` instead (returns `Uint8Array | null`).
    - `IFile.getBufferOrFail` — use `IFile.getBytesOrFail` instead (returns `Uint8Array` or throws).
    - `IFile.getReadable` — use `IFile.getStream` instead (returns a readable stream).
    - `IFile.getReadableOrFail` — use `IFile.getStreamOrFail` instead (returns a readable stream or throws).

    **Removed behaviour:**

    - Built-in locking from the `FileStorage` class — locking is now provided by the standalone `withFileStorageLock` plugin.

    ### New Plugin-Based Capabilities

    **`withFileStorageLock`** — Adds distributed locking to file storage operations.

    - Import path: `@daiso-tech/core/file-storage/plugins`

    ```ts
    import { withPlugin } from "@daiso-tech/core/middleware";
    import { withFileStorageLock } from "@daiso-tech/core/file-storage/plugins";
    import { MemoryFileStorageAdapter } from "@daiso-tech/core/file-storage/memory-file-storage-adapter";
    import { MemoryLockFactory } from "@daiso-tech/core/lock/memory-lock-factory";

    const adapter = withPlugin(
        new MemoryFileStorageAdapter(),
        withFileStorageLock({ lockFactory: new MemoryLockFactory() }),
    );
    ```

    ### Migration
    - Replace all calls to `getBuffer(key)` with `getBytes(key)`.
    - Replace all calls to `getBufferOrFail(key)` with `getBytesOrFail(key)`.
    - Replace all calls to `getReadable(key)` with `getStream(key)`.
    - Replace all calls to `getReadableOrFail(key)` with `getStreamOrFail(key)`.
    - If you relied on the built-in locking, apply the `withFileStorageLock` plugin to your file storage adapter as shown above.

- 65e14ba: ## Architectural Shift: Composable `with*Prefix` Plugins

    The built-in namespacing system has been refactored into opt-in `with*Prefix` plugins across all affected components. The `@daiso-tech/core/namespace` module has been removed entirely. Key management is now simplified to plain strings, and prefixing is handled via middleware plugins when needed.

    ### Motivation

    The previous namespace system (`INamespace`, `IKey`, `Namespace` class) added unnecessary complexity for what is fundamentally a string-prefixing concern. Every component had to carry namespace configuration through its settings, and keys were wrapped in `IKey` objects instead of plain strings. This made the API harder to use and increased bundle size for users who didn't need namespacing.

    The new approach removes the namespace abstraction entirely. Key prefixing is now an opt-in `PluginFn` applied directly to the adapter, keeping the core components simple and the API surface clean.

    ### Breaking Changes

    **Removed `@daiso-tech/core/namespace` module:**

    - `INamespace` contract
    - `IKey` interface
    - `Namespace` class
    - `NoOpNamespace` class

    **Removed `namespace` setting** from component constructors:

    - `Cache` — `CacheSettingsBase.namespace`
    - `EventBus` — `EventBusSettingsBase.namespace`
    - `LockFactory` — `LockFactorySettingsBase.namespace`
    - `CircuitBreakerFactory`, `FileStorage`, `RateLimiterFactory`, `SemaphoreFactory`, `SharedLockFactory` — same pattern

    **Simplified key types** across all components:

    - All method parameters changed from `IKey` to `string`
    - `removeMany(keys: Iterable<string>)` changed to `removeMany(keys: Array<string>)`
    - Error classes (`KeyNotFoundCacheError`, `KeyExistsCacheError`, etc.) now accept `string` instead of `IKey`
    - `ILockState.key` changed from `IKey` to `string`

    ### New Plugin-Based Capabilities

    Key prefixing is now opt-in via middleware plugins. Available plugins:

    | Component       | Plugin                     | Import path                                |
    | --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
    | cache           | `withCachePrefix`          | `@daiso-tech/core/cache/plugins`           |
    | circuit-breaker | `withCircuitBreakerPrefix` | `@daiso-tech/core/circuit-breaker/plugins` |
    | file-storage    | `withFileStoragePrefix`    | `@daiso-tech/core/file-storage/plugins`    |
    | lock            | `withLockPrefix`           | `@daiso-tech/core/lock/plugins`            |
    | rate-limiter    | `withRateLimiterPrefix`    | `@daiso-tech/core/rate-limiter/plugins`    |
    | semaphore       | `withSemaphorePrefix`      | `@daiso-tech/core/semaphore/plugins`       |
    | shared-lock     | `withSharedLockPrefix`     | `@daiso-tech/core/shared-lock/plugins`     |
    | event-bus       | `withEventBusPrefix`       | `@daiso-tech/core/event-bus/plugins`       |

    ```ts
    import { withPlugin } from "@daiso-tech/core/middleware";
    import { withCachePrefix } from "@daiso-tech/core/cache/plugins";

    const adapter = withPlugin(
        new MemoryCacheAdapter(),
        withCachePrefix("tenant-42:"),
    );

    // Keys are automatically prefixed:
    await adapter.add(context, "my-key", "value");
    // Internally calls adapter.add(context, "tenant-42:my-key", "value")
    ```

    ### How the New Architecture Works

    Instead of passing a `Namespace` instance to the component constructor, prefixing is now applied at the adapter level. The `with*Prefix` plugin intercepts key-related method calls and prepends the configured prefix before forwarding to the underlying adapter. This keeps components adapter-agnostic and makes prefixing composable with other plugins.

    ### Migration

    **If you used `Namespace` directly**, replace with a `with*Prefix` plugin on the adapter:

    ```diff
    -import { Cache, Namespace } from "@daiso-tech/core";
    -
    -const cache = new Cache({
    -    adapter: new MemoryCacheAdapter(),
    -    namespace: new Namespace("my-app"),
    -});
    +import { Cache } from "@daiso-tech/core";
    +import { withPlugin } from "@daiso-tech/core/middleware";
    +import { withCachePrefix } from "@daiso-tech/core/cache/plugins";
    +
    +const adapter = withPlugin(new MemoryCacheAdapter(), withCachePrefix("my-app:"));
    +const cache = new Cache({ adapter });
    ```

    **If you imported `INamespace` or `IKey` types**, update to use plain `string` instead.

    **If you were using `NoOpNamespace`**, simply omit the `namespace` setting (it was the default).

## 0.55.0

### Minor Changes

- 7edaf05: ### Middleware Component Overhaul

    - **Decoupled middleware from execution-context**: The middleware component no longer depends on the `execution-context` component. The `Use` type and `useFactory` implementation have been refactored to remove the `IExecutionContext` dependency — middleware can now receive context via other mechanisms.
    - **Added `WithPlugin` contract and `withPluginFactory`**: Introduced the `WithPlugin` type and `withPluginFactory(enhance)` implementation, which applies one or more plugins (function or object-based) to an object instance, each receiving the instance and an `Enhance` function.

    ### Resilience Middleware Renaming

    All resilience component middleware factories have been renamed from `{name}-middleware-factory` to `with-{name}-factory` for a more consistent and descriptive naming convention:

    - **Cache**: `cacheMiddlewareFactory` → `withCacheFactory`
    - **Circuit Breaker**: `circuitBreakerMiddlewareFactory` → `withCircuitBreakerFactory`
    - **Lock**: `lockMiddlewareFactory` → `withLockFactory`
    - **Rate Limiter**: `rateLimiterMiddlewareFactory` → `withRateLimiterFactory` (detected as rename)
    - **Semaphore**: `semaphoreMiddlewareFactory` → `withSemaphoreFactory`
    - **Shared Lock**: `sharedLockMiddlewareFactory` → `withSharedLockFactory`

    ### Context Dependency Updates

    All resilience components now depend on `IReadableContext` instead of `IExecutionContext`:

    - Cache
    - Circuit Breaker
    - Event Bus
    - File Storage
    - Lock
    - Rate Limiter
    - Semaphore
    - Shared Lock

- 6fcfd1f: ### Middleware system simplification

    The middleware module has been simplified by removing the factory layer and exposing pre-configured public APIs directly.

    #### Breaking changes
    - **`useFactory` is now internal.** Instead of calling `useFactory()` to create a `Use` function, import the pre-configured `use` constant directly from `@daiso-tech/core/middleware`.
    - **`enhanceFactory` is now internal.** Instead of calling `enhanceFactory(use)` to create an `Enhance` function, import the pre-configured `enhance` constant directly from `@daiso-tech/core/middleware`.
    - **`withPluginFactory` is now internal.** Instead of calling `withPluginFactory(enhance)` to create a `WithPlugin` function, import the pre-configured `withPlugin` constant directly from `@daiso-tech/core/middleware`.
    - **`UseFactorySettings` type and `defaultPriority` option removed.** `useFactory` no longer accepts a settings object. The default priority for function-based middlewares is now always `0`. To assign a custom priority, set the `priority` property on an `IMiddlewareObject`.

    #### New public API
    - Added `use` — a pre-configured middleware application function. Import directly from `@daiso-tech/core/middleware`.
    - Added `enhance` — a pre-configured method enhancer. Import directly from `@daiso-tech/core/middleware`.
    - Added `withPlugin` — a pre-configured plugin applicator. Import directly from `@daiso-tech/core/middleware`.

    #### Migration guide

    **Before:**

    ```ts
    import {
        useFactory,
        enhanceFactory,
        withPluginFactory,
    } from "@daiso-tech/core/middleware";

    const use = useFactory();
    const enhance = enhanceFactory(use);
    const withPlugin = withPluginFactory(enhance);
    ```

    **After:**

    ```ts
    import { use, enhance, withPlugin } from "@daiso-tech/core/middleware";
    ```

    You cannot rely on `defaultPriority` setting, all middlewares default priorities are `0`.

### Minor Changes

- e0f63c8: Added new middlewares factories:

    - `cacheMiddlewareFactory`
    - `circuitBreakerMiddlewareFactory`
    - `lockMiddlewareFactory`
    - `rateLimiterMiddlewareFactory`
    - `semaphoreMiddlewareFactory`
    - `sharedLockMiddlewareFactory`

- e0f63c8: Added new middleware utility `enhanceFactory` that allows apply middlewares to methods.

    Works with object literal methods:

    ```ts
    import {
        enhanceFactory,
        type MiddlewareFn,
    } from "@daiso-tech/core/middleware";

    const enhance = enhanceFactory();
    function log<TReturn>(): MiddlewareFn<TParameters, Promise<TReturn>> {
        return async ({ next, args }) => {
            const argsAsStr = args.map((arg) => String(arg)).join(", ");
            console.log(`args: ${argsAsStr}`);
            return await next();
        };
    }

    const obj = {
        async hello(name: string): Promise<string> {
            return `Hello world, ${name}`;
        },
    };
    enhance(obj, "hello", [log()]);

    // Will log "args: Jhon"
    await obj.hello("Jhon");
    ```

    Works with instance methods:

    ```ts
    import {
        enhanceFactory,
        type MiddlewareFn,
    } from "@daiso-tech/core/middleware";

    const enhance = enhanceFactory();
    function log<TReturn>(): MiddlewareFn<TParameters, Promise<TReturn>> {
        return async ({ next, args }) => {
            const argsAsStr = args.map((arg) => String(arg)).join(", ");
            console.log(`args: ${argsAsStr}`);
            return await next();
        };
    }

    class Obj {
        async hello(name: string): Promise<string> {
            return `Hello world, ${name}`;
        }
    }
    const obj = new Obj();
    enhance(obj, "hello", [log()]);

    // Will log "args: Jhon"
    await obj.hello("Jhon");
    ```

    Works with static methods:

    ```ts
    import {
        enhanceFactory,
        type MiddlewareFn,
    } from "@daiso-tech/core/middleware";

    const enhance = enhanceFactory();
    function log<TReturn>(): MiddlewareFn<TParameters, Promise<TReturn>> {
        return async ({ next, args }) => {
            const argsAsStr = args.map((arg) => String(arg)).join(", ");
            console.log(`args: ${argsAsStr}`);
            return await next();
        };
    }

    class Obj {
        static async hello(name: string): Promise<string> {
            return `Hello world, ${name}`;
        }
    }
    enhance(Obj, "hello", [log()]);

    // Will log "args: Jhon"
    await Obj.hello("Jhon");
    ```

    Works with prototypes methods:

    ```ts
    import {
        enhanceFactory,
        type MiddlewareFn,
    } from "@daiso-tech/core/middleware";

    const enhance = enhanceFactory();
    function log<TReturn>(): MiddlewareFn<TParameters, Promise<TReturn>> {
        return async ({ next, args }) => {
            const argsAsStr = args.map((arg) => String(arg)).join(", ");
            console.log(`args: ${argsAsStr}`);
            return await next();
        };
    }

    class Obj {
        async hello(name: string): Promise<string> {
            return `Hello world, ${name}`;
        }
    }
    enhance(Obj.prototype, "hello", [log()]);

    const obj = new Obj();

    // Will log "args: Jhon"
    await obj.hello("Jhon");
    ```

- 3a3df7c: - **Unified Middleware System**: Introduced a new middleware component that replaces the legacy Hooks system. - **Hybrid Support**: Natively handles both synchronous and asynchronous functions within a single interface. - **Execution Context**: Added full support for passing execution context through the middleware chain. - **Priority Management**: Built-in support for defining execution order via priority levels.

    ### Changed
    - **Removed Hooks Component**: The legacy Hooks system has been removed to reduce architectural complexity.
        - **Simplified API**: Removed the need for separate classes for sync and async hooks, significantly reducing boilerplate.
        - **Refined DX**: Replaced the verbose and complex Hooks API with a more ergonomic and streamlined middleware pattern.

- 8ecb340: #### Breaking Changes

    The `Task` class and `ITask` contract have been removed completely. Now native `Promise` is used across following components:

    - cache
    - collection
    - event-bus
    - file-storage
    - rate-limiter
    - circuit-breaker
    - lock
    - semaphore
    - shared-lock

    #### New Features
    - Added a reusable delay utility
    - The following classes support `waitUntil` configuration, facilitating seamless integration with serverless environments like `Vercel`, `Cloudflare`, and `Netlify`:
        - `Cache`
        - `LockFactory`
        - `SemaphoreFactory`
        - `SharedLockFactory`
        - `CircuitBreakerFactory`
        - `RateLimiterFactory`
        - `FileStorage`
        - `EventBus`

### Patch Changes

- 068bdc6: # Summary

    Introduced the `retryInterval` middleware and streamlined the concurrency API by removing legacy blocking methods.

    ## Breaking Changes

    Removed several "blocking" methods across the locking and semaphore contracts. These methods are now redundant, as their behavior can be more flexibly achieved using the new `retryInterval` middleware.

    **Affected Methods:**

    - `ILock`: `acquireBlocking`, `acquireBlockingOrFail`, `runBlockingOrFail`
    - `ISemaphore`: `acquireBlocking`, `acquireBlockingOrFail`, `runBlockingOrFail`
    - `ISharedLock`:
        - Writer: `acquireWriterBlocking`, `acquireWriterBlockingOrFail`, `runWriterBlockingOrFail`
        - Reader: `acquireReaderBlocking`, `acquireReaderBlockingOrFail`, `runReaderBlockingOrFail`

    ## New Features
    - **`retryInterval` Middleware**: A new utility that retries a function call at a specified interval until a defined timeout is reached. This provides a unified way to handle retries across the framework without needing specialized "blocking" variants of every method.

        remove(key: string): Promise<ILockExpirationData | null>;

        removeIfOwner(key: string, owner: string): Promise<ILockData | null>;

        updateExpirationIfOwner(
            key: string,
            owner: string,
            expiration: Date,

            expiration: Date,
        ): Promise<number>;

        find(key: string): Promise<ILockData | null>;
    };
    ```

- 974f5e3: ## Feature: Introducing `ITimeSpan` Contract for Flexible Time Handling ⏱️

    A new contract, `ITimeSpan`, has been introduced:

    ```ts
    export const TO_MILLISECONDS = Symbol("TO_MILLISECONDS");

    export type ITimeSpan = {
        /**
         * Converts the time span to its total duration in milliseconds.
         */
        [TO_MILLISECONDS](): number;
    };
    ```

    By replacing the concrete `TimeSpan` class with this interface, we achieve greater flexibility and interoperability. This makes it easy for developers to use external time libraries (e.g., `Luxon`) by simply implementing `ITimeSpan` on their duration objects.

- d4cd60b: Updated `LockProviderCreateSettings` type.

    before:

    ```ts
    export type LockProviderCreateSettings = {
        ttl?: TimeSpan | null;

        owner?: OneOrMore<string>;
    };
    ```

    after:

    ```ts
    export type LockProviderCreateSettings = {
        ttl?: TimeSpan | null;

        lockId?: string;
    };
    ```

- d4cd60b: Updated `ILock` contract.

    - Removed the method `getRemainingTime`.
    - Removed the method `getOwner`.
    - Removed the method `isExpired`.
    - Removed the method `isLocked`.
    - Added `getState` method that replaces the following methods `getRemainingTime`, `getOwner`, `isExpired` and `isLocked`.
    - Added `key` readonly field that returns the lock instance key.
    - Added `id` readonly field that returns the lock instance id.
    - Added `ttl` readonly field that returns the lock instance ttl.
    - The `refreshOrFail` now only throws one error, it throws `FailedRefreshLockError`

- 9d85f6c: - Renamed constant variable `ASYNC_ERRORS` to `RESILIENCE_ERRORS`.

    - Removed base `ResilienceError` class.
    - Removed `bulkhead` middleware.
    - Removed `sequentialHedging` and `concurrentHedging` middlewares.
    - Removed resilience error hierarchy.

- eb98bd2: - Added new contract `IComparable`, `IGreaterThan`, `IGreaterThanOrEquals`, `ILessThan` and `ILessThanOrEquals` which are used for comparing objects.

    - Updated `TimeSpan` class so it implements the `IComparable` contract.

- 93c3c3a: Added new default namespaces for the following components:

    - `Cache`
    - `CacheFactory`
    - `EventBus`
    - `EventBusFactory`
    - `LockProvider`
    - `LockFactory`

    Now you can use following constant variables:

    - ```ts
      const DEFAULT_CACHE_NAMESPACE = new Namespace("@cache");
      ```
    - ```ts
      const DEFAULT_EVENT_BUS_NAMESPACE = new Namespace("@event-bus");
      ```
    - ```ts
      const DEFAULT_LOCK_PROVIDER_NAMESPACE = new Namespace("@lock-provider");
      ```

- d4cd60b: Updated LockProviderFactory class.

    - Renamed `setCreateOwnerId` to `setCreateLockId`.

- d4cd60b: Updated and removed some lock events.

    - Renamed error `KeyAlreadyAcquiredLockError` to `FailedAcquireLockError`.
    - Renamed error `UnownedReleaseLockError` to `FailedReleaseLockError`.
    - Renamed error `UnownedRefreshLockError` to `FailedRefreshLockError`.

- eb98bd2: Update `TimeSpan` class `fromDateRange` method arguments. Now it only takes on required argument which is an object of type `TimeSpanFromDateRangeSettings`.

    ````ts
    export type TimeSpanFromDateRangeSettings = {
        /**
         * @default
         * ```ts
         * new Date()
         * ```
         */
        start?: Date;

        /**
         * @default
         * ```ts
         * new Date()
         * ```
         */
        end?: Date;
    };
    ````

- d4cd60b: Renamed, updated and removed some lock events.

    - Renamed event `UnownedReleaseTryLockEvent` to `FailedReleaseLockEvent`.
    - Renamed event `UnownedRefreshTryLockEvent` to `FailedRefreshLockEvent`.
    - Removed event `UnexpireableKeyRefreshTryLockEvent`.

    ```ts
    export type NamespaceSettings = {
        identifierDelimeter?: string;

        keyDelimeter?: string;

        rootIdentifier?: string;
    };
    ```

    after:

    ```ts
    /**
     *
     * IMPORT_PATH: `"@daiso-tech/core/utilities"`
     * @group Namespace
     */
    export type NamespaceSettings = {
        delimeter?: string;

        rootIdentifier?: string;
    };
    ```

- d4cd60b: Update the `ILockAdapter` contract.

    before:

    ```ts
    export type ILockAdapter = {
        acquire(
            key: string,
            owner: string,
            ttl: TimeSpan | null,
        ): Promise<boolean>;

        release(key: string, owner: string): Promise<boolean>;

        forceRelease(key: string): Promise<boolean>;

        refresh(
            key: string,
            owner: string,
            ttl: TimeSpan,
        ): Promise<LockRefreshResult>;
    };
    ```

    after:

    ```ts
    export type ILockAdapter = {
        acquire(
            key: string,

        refresh(key: string, lockId: string, ttl: TimeSpan): Promise<boolean>;

        getState(key: string): Promise<ILockAdapterState | null>;
    };
    ```

- 4ce80a4: Updated `ICacheBase` contract to not use `OneOrMore` types as keys meaning you cannot pass in an iterable of string as a key.

    `ICacheBase` contract before:

    ```ts
    export type ICacheBase<TType = unknown> = {
        exists(key: OneOrMore<string>): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        missing(key: OneOrMore<string>): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        get(key: OneOrMore<string>): LazyPromise<TType | null>;

        getOrFail(key: OneOrMore<string>): LazyPromise<TType>;

        getAndRemove(key: OneOrMore<string>): LazyPromise<TType | null>;

        getOr(
            key: OneOrMore<string>,
            defaultValue: AsyncLazyable<NoneFunc<TType>>,
        ): LazyPromise<TType>;

        getOrAdd(
            key: OneOrMore<string>,
            valueToAdd: AsyncLazyable<NoneFunc<TType>>,
            ttl?: ITimeSpan | null,
        ): LazyPromise<TType>;

        add(
            key: OneOrMore<string>,
            value: TType,
            ttl?: ITimeSpan | null,
        ): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        put(
            key: OneOrMore<string>,
            value: TType,
            ttl?: ITimeSpan | null,
        ): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        update(key: OneOrMore<string>, value: TType): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        increment(
            key: OneOrMore<string>,
            value?: Extract<TType, number>,
        ): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        decrement(
            key: OneOrMore<string>,
            value?: Extract<TType, number>,
        ): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        remove(key: OneOrMore<string>): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        removeMany(keys: Iterable<OneOrMore<string>>): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        clear(): LazyPromise<void>;
    };
    ```

    `ICacheBase` contract after:

    ```ts
    export type ICacheBase<TType = unknown> = {
        exists(key: string): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        missing(key: string): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        get(key: string): LazyPromise<TType | null>;

        getOrFail(key: string): LazyPromise<TType>;

        getAndRemove(key: string): LazyPromise<TType | null>;

        getOr(
            key: string,
            defaultValue: AsyncLazyable<NoneFunc<TType>>,
        ): LazyPromise<TType>;

        getOrAdd(
            key: string,
            valueToAdd: AsyncLazyable<NoneFunc<TType>>,
            ttl?: ITimeSpan | null,
        ): LazyPromise<TType>;

        add(
            key: string,
            value: TType,
            ttl?: ITimeSpan | null,
        ): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        put(
            key: string,
            value: TType,
            ttl?: ITimeSpan | null,
        ): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        update(key: string, value: TType): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        increment(
            key: string,
            value?: Extract<TType, number>,
        ): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        decrement(
            key: string,
            value?: Extract<TType, number>,
        ): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        remove(key: string): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        removeMany(keys: Iterable<string>): LazyPromise<boolean>;

        clear(): LazyPromise<void>;
    };
    ```

## 0.40.0

### Minor Changes

- 99e8913: Simplified `ILockAdapter` methods, now they return `Promise` instead of `PromiseLike`. Also updated `forceRelease` and `refresh` methods:
    - `forceRelease` method returns true if the lock was released or false if the lock doesnt exists.
    - `forceRelease` method returns `LockRefreshResult` enum instead of `boolean`.
- 99e8913: Updated `IDatabaseLockAdapter` contract.

    Before update:

    ```ts
    export type ILockData = {
        owner: string;
        expiration: Date | null;
    };

    export type IDatabaseLockAdapter = {
        insert(
            key: string,
            owner: string,
            expiration: Date | null,
        ): PromiseLike<void>;

        update(
            key: string,
            owner: string,
            expiration: Date | null,
        ): PromiseLike<number>;

        remove(key: string, owner: string | null): PromiseLike<void>;

        refresh(
            key: string,
            owner: string,
            expiration: Date,
        ): PromiseLike<number>;

        find(key: string): PromiseLike<ILockData | null>;
    };
    ```

    After update:

    ```ts
    export type ILockExpirationData = {
        expiration: Date | null;
    };

    export type ILockData = ILockExpirationData & {
        owner: string;
    };

    export type IDatabaseLockAdapter = {
        insert(
            key: string,
            owner: string,
            expiration: Date | null,
        ): Promise<void>;

        updateIfExpired(
            key: string,
            owner: string,
            expiration: Date | null,
        ): Promise<number>;

        remove(key: string): Promise<ILockExpirationData | null>;

        removeIfOwner(key: string, owner: string): Promise<ILockData | null>;

        updateExpirationIfOwner(
            key: string,
            owner: string,
            expiration: Date,
        ): Promise<number>;

        find(key: string): Promise<ILockData | null>;
    };
    ```

- 85d0b53: Simplified the `IEventBusAdapter` it now uses `Promises` intead of `PromiseLike`
- 99e8913: Updated `ILock` contract, now `forceRelease` method returns `true` when if the lock was released or `false` if the lock doesnt exists.
- 9b004d2: Simplified `ICacheAdapter` and `IDatabaseCacheAdapter`, now they return `Promise` instead of `PromiseLike`
- 99e8913: Updated `IPrunable`, `IDeinitizable`, and `IInitizable` contracts, they now use Promises instead of PromiseLike

## 0.39.0

### Minor Changes

- 7d25a1f: Removed `UnexpectedLockError`, `UnexpectedCollectionError`, `UnexpectedCacheError`, `registerLockErrorsToSerde`, `registerCahceErrorsToSerde`, `registerCollectionErrorsToSerde`, removed `EventBusError` and `UnexpectedEventBusError`

## 0.38.0

### Minor Changes

- 279becc: Update `HedgingSettings.waitTime` field. Instead you can now pass in a middlewares that wrap the primary function and fallback function.
- 90340f9: Now the `fallback` middleware works with `Result` type, meaning the middleware will add a fallback value when the function returns a failed `Result`.
- 32f0a88: Changed the result type to be object instead of an array
- 90340f9: The `observe` middleware works now with `Result` type. This means the middleware will call the `onError` callback when the function returns a failed `Result`.
- 90340f9: Removed `RetryAsyncError`. Now the `retry` middleware will throw the last error.
- 279becc: Removed `concurrentHedging` middleware because it was buggy and unreliable.
- 90340f9: Now the `retry` middleware works with `Result` type, meaning the middleware will retry when the function returns a failed `Result`.
- 90340f9: The `ErrorPolicy` type has been updated and now you can pass a class. The `ErrorPolicy` will verify whether the error is an instance of that class.
- 8608081: Now `ErrorPolicy` can handle return values that are false boolean values.
- ba6907b: Removed the following `EventBus` errors:

    - `UnableToRemoveListenerEventBusError`

- ba6907b: Removed the following `LockProvider` errors:

    - `UnableToReleaseLockError`
    - `UnableToAquireLockError`

    `LockProvider` errors obscures unexpected errors originating from the underlying client, making it harder to identify the root cause.

## 0.36.0

### Minor Changes

- 3ca9190: Renamed `FallbackSettings.fallbackPolicy` to `FallbackSettings.errorPolicy`
- 3ca9190: - Removed the following types:

                                                                                                                                      - `AsyncFactoryable`

    - Updated remaining factory types to use the new `InvokableFn` and `InvokableObject` contracts:
        - Synchronous factories:
            - `FactoryFn`
            - `IFactoryObject`
            - `Factory`
        - Asynchronous factories:
            - `AsyncFactoryFn`
            - `IAsyncFactoryObject`
            - `AsyncFactory`

    This change simplifies the type hierarchy and ensures consistent behavior between factory and invokable patterns.

    - `setIdentifierDelimeter` method: allows for overriding `NamespaceSettings.identifierDelimeter`
    - `setKeyDelimeter` method: allows for overriding `NamespaceSettings.keyDelimeter`
    - `setRootIdentifier` method: allows for overriding `NamespaceSettings.rootIdentifier`
    - `appendRoot` method: allows for appending to `InternalNamespace` class constructor argument `_rootPrefix`

- 3ca9190: Added new types `ResultFailure` and `ResultSuccess`.
- 3ca9190: Made `CacheSettingsBase.namespace` optional by using default value

- b7438c6: Updated `concurentHedging middleware to abort promises by AbortSignal`

## 0.35.0

### Minor Changes

- a2c56f4: Added a new `sequentialHedging` middleware that executes the primary function and all fallback functions sequentially.
  It returns the result of the first successful function and automatically cancels all remaining function.
  If all function fail than error is thrown.
- a2c56f4: Updated the settings of `dynamic`, `fallback`, `hedging`, `observe`, `retry`, and `timeout` middlewares.
- a2c56f4: Updated the `AsyncHook` class to accept an `AbortSignalBinder` parameter. This enables binding an `AbortSignal` to the middleware for two-way abortion control.
  The `AsyncHook` know exposes function name to the middleware function which is useful for logging.
- f604f53: Simplified the `IEventBus` contract to use event map instead of classes for events. The following classes / contracts are effected:
    - `ILockProvider` contract and `LockProvider` class.
    - `ICache` contract and `Cache` class.
    - `IFlexibleSerde` contract and `Serde` class.
        - The `registerEvent` method is not needed longer and thereby is removed.
- f604f53: Renamed the cache events.
- a2c56f4: Updated `Hook` class. It know exposes function name to the middleware function which can is useful for logging.

- f604f53: Renamed the lock events.
- a2c56f4: Added a new `concurrentHedging` middleware executes the primary function and all fallback functions concurrently.
  It returns the result of the first successful function and automatically aborts all remaining functions.
  If all function fail than error is thrown.

## 0.34.0

### Minor Changes

- 7e5a059: Added new utility `Hooks` class which allows for adding middlewares to any sync functions.
- 96e2f95: Removed `delay`, `takeUntilAbort` `takeUntilTimeout` from `IAsyncCollection` contract.
- 96e2f95: Following methods where removed from `LazyPromise`:

    - `setAbortSignal`
    - `setTotalTimeout`
    - `setRetryTimeout`
    - `setRetryPolicy`
    - `setRetryAttempts`
    - `setBackofPolicy`

    The new approach allows you to apply `AsyncMiddleware` to `LazyPromise` by the `pipe` and `pipeWhen` methods. This change promotes a more composable and extendable design while reducing API surface area.

- f8a6439: Added following middlewares:
    - `dynamic`: Enables runtime configuration of other middlewares for flexible behavior adjustments.
    - `fallback`: Provides a default value or fallback mechanism when an error occurs.
    - `retry`: Automatically retries failed operations with customizable retry policies.
    - `timeout`: Ensures functions terminate after a specified duration to prevent hanging.
    - `observe`: Monitors async functions, tracking success/failure states for logging or analytics.
- 7e5a059: Added new utility `AsyncHooks` class which allows for adding middlewares to any sync and async functions.

    - `ListCollection`
    - `IterableCollection`
    - `AsyncIterableCollection`

## 0.33.0

### Minor Changes

- 653a224: Removed `IGroupableLockProvider` contract and remove `getGroup` method from `ILockProvider` meaning you cant longer use `withGroup` and `getGroup` methods of the `LockProvider`class. This feature was not flexible.
- de018b1: Changed `EventBus` class so it cannot take adapter factory. This feature was not flexible and unnecessary.
- f54390c: Removed the `group` field from all `ICache` events.
- ab20280: Removed `IGroupableCache` contract and remove `getGroup` method from `ICache` meaning you cant longer use `withGroup` and `getGroup` methods of the `Cache`class. This feature was not flexible.
